# Welcome to WayPoint Ventures documentation

The WayPoint Ventures documentation website provides guides, videos, and other resources to help you develop, review, edit, and prepare course content.

## How to use this website

The [Quick start]({{site.baseurl}}/quickstart/quickstart.html) provides a collection of guides, on a single page, that are essential to contributing content. Authors, Reviewers, and other contributors will find the quick start useful to understanding what's required to "get up and running" quickly.

Alternatively, choose a single guide from the left sidebar menu. If you're a new contributor, after you complete the guides in the section [Install software]({{site.baseurl}}/install/install-vsc.html), the guides [FAQ]({{site.baseurl}}/appendices/faq.html) and [Terminology and concepts]({{site.baseurl}}/workflow/terminology.html) are good to start with.

> **Note**: Some guides are specific to courses that use **GitHub**, while others are specific to courses that use **Azure DevOps** (AzDevOps). Use the **Repository type** button, as shown in the following image, to select **GitHub** or **Azure DevOps**, according to the requirements for the project/ course you're working on. If you're unsure about the type of repository (repo) to choose, ask your project manager.

## Prerequisites

Before you proceed, note the following prerequisites:

### GitHub courses

- You need a GitHub user account to complete the guides on this website. If you don't have a GitHub account, create one using the [GitHub account setup guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/contribute/get-started-setup-github).
- Choose a GitHub username that will distinguish you and your contributions from others on GitHub. For example, use a variation of your first and/ or second name as your GitHub username.
- The email address associated with your GitHub user account, and your GitHub username, are required to complete the guides.
- Most GitHub projects use private GitHub repos. You must receive and accept an invitation to access a private GitHub repo and make contributions. When you create your GitHub account, send an email to your project manager requesting access to your project's GitHub repo.
