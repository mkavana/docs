# Welcome to WayPoint Ventures documentation

This WayPoint Ventures documentation website provides guides, videos, and other resources to help you develop, review, edit, and prepare content for a typical course (project).

> **Note**: Procedures and processes vary according to requirements of each course/ project. Supplement the resources on this website with other official Waypoint documentation and supports. Your project manager can help you locate the Waypoint documentation and supports that are available for the specific project you're working on.

## How to use this website

The [Quick start]({{site.baseurl}}/quickstart/quickstart.html) provides a collection of guides, on a single page, that are essential to contributing content. Authors, Reviewers, and other contributors will find the quick start useful to understanding what's required to "get up and running" quickly.

Alternatively, choose a single guide from the left sidebar menu. If you're a new contributor, after you complete the guides in the section [Install software]({{site.baseurl}}/install/install-vsc.html), the guides [FAQ]({{site.baseurl}}/appendices/faq.html) and [Terminology and concepts]({{site.baseurl}}/workflow/terminology.html) are good to start with.

> **Note**: Some guides are specific to projects that use **GitHub**, while others are specific to projects that use **Azure DevOps** (AzDevOps). Use the **Repository type** button, as shown in the following image, to select **GitHub** or **AzDevOps**, according to the requirements for the project you're working on. If you're unsure about the type of repository (repo) to choose, ask your project manager.

## Prerequisites

Before you proceed, note the following prerequisites:

- You need a GitHub or AzDevOps user account to complete the guides on this website. If you don't have a GitHub account, create one using the [GitHub account setup guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/contribute/get-started-setup-github). To create an AzDevOps account, refer to [Sign up, sign in to Azure DevOps](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/user-guide/sign-up-invite-teammates?view=azure-devops).
- Choose a GitHub/ AzDevOps username that will distinguish you and your contributions from others on GitHub/ AzDevOps. For example, use a variation of your first and/ or second name as your GitHub/ AzDevOps username.
- The email address associated with your GitHub/ AzDevOps user account, and your username, are required to complete the guides.
- Most projects use private GitHub/ AzDevOps repos. You must receive and accept an invitation to access a private repo and make contributions. When you create your GitHub/ AzDevOps account, send an email to your project manager requesting access to your project's repo.

> **Note**: If your project involves making direct contributions to a **Microsoft Docs** repo on GitHub, you'll need a **v-** ("v dash") account. You must link your **v-** and GitHub accounts. For information about linking your accounts, refer to [Configure your GitHub user account]({{site.baseurl}}/download-files/fork-repo.html#fork-config-user), and to [Microsoft Docs contributor guide overview](https://docs.microsoft.com/contribute/).
