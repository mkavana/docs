This guide describes the general **Test** process for a typical project.

> **Note**: The test process described in this guide is generalized and is not intended to capture the process entirely. Test processes can vary between projects and you should ask your project manager about the specific test processes that apply to the course you are working on.

## Overview of the test process {#test-overview}

In addition to reviews, the content developed for some projects must be tested at various stages in the project's life cycle. Examples of tests include checking the content for plagiarism, inclusive design and hyperlink integrity. How and when tests are conducted can vary between projects. Ask your project manager about the specific test processes that apply to the course you are working on.

The following are key points about the test process.

- Test are typically conducted on content that has passed the review stages (on a module-by-module basis or when the content for a complete course has passed the review stages).
- Most testers work outside the project's remote repository. For example, some tests are conducted on the Microsoft Word Documents generated from the markdown files for a course.
- Generally, any changes to files in a project's remote repository that are required by a tester will be applied by a reviewer, editor or content author. The reviewer, editor or content author will work with the tester to apply necessary changes to content in order to progress the content through the test process successfully.
- Testers do not usually need to create a Git 'test branch' to work in (as changes to files are normally applied by a reviewer).
