This guide describes how to fork a GitHub repository (repo).

> **Note**: As an example, this guide forks the GitHub repo **MicrosoftDocs/learn-pr** from [https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/learn-pr/](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/learn-pr/). Apply this guide to any suitable *private* GitHub repo by adapting the steps accordingly.

## About forking and cloning a GitHub repo {#fork-about}

The following describes why it's necessary to fork the GitHub repo **MicrosoftDocs/learn-pr**, and distinguishes forking from cloning.

Microsoft protect the contents of the GitHub repo **MicrosoftDocs/learn-pr**. Only authorized GitHub users can modify files in **MicrosoftDocs/learn-pr** directly.

To make your contributions you *must* create a copy of **MicrosoftDocs/learn-pr** called a **fork**. Forking will copy the contents of **MicrosoftDocs/learn-pr** into *your GitHub user account*. You are the owner/ Admin of *your* GitHub account. When you fork **MicrosoftDocs/learn-pr** into *your* GitHub account, you'll have full permission to modify the files in *your fork*. After you create your fork, you can access your fork in a web browser from the following URL:

`https:// github.com/ your GitHub username /learn-pr`.

> **Note**: If you download (clone) **MicrosoftDocs/learn-pr** *directly* onto your computer, *without first making a fork*, your clone will inherit Microsoft's user access restrictions from **MicrosoftDocs/learn-pr**. If your clone inherits Microsoft's user access restrictions, you won't have permission to modify the files in your clone. This is why *you must first create a fork in your GitHub user account*.
>

After you [Fork a GitHub repo](#fork-repo), you can [Modify a forked file in a web browser on GitHub](#fork-github-edit). If you prefer to modify files using Visual Studio Code (VSC), clone *your fork* onto your computer, and then [Modify a forked file in VSC](#fork-vsc). Cloning *your fork* ensures you'll have permission to modify the files in VSC.

### The differences between forks and clones

Forks and clones are essentially copies of a repo, with the following basic differences (in the context of the **Waypoint 2022 DevRel** project).

- **Cloning**. Copies the GitHub repo onto a user's *computer*. A clone will *inherit any file access restrictions* from its parent.
- **Forking**. Copies the GitHub repo into the user's *GitHub account*. The user can then clone *their fork* without worrying about restricted access to protected files (because the user owns *their fork*).

After you've modified a file in your fork you *must* ask the Microsoft Docs team to merge your file changes from your fork into **MicrosoftDocs/learn-pr**. To ask the Microsoft Docs team to merge your file changes, [Create a pull request from your forked repo on GitHub](#fork-pr).

### Benefits to creating your own fork

Creating a fork is a standard practice that’s required for contributing to Microsoft Docs. The fork you create gives you the following benefits:

- **Full read/ write permissions for the files in your fork**. You can’t modify files in **MicrosoftDocs/learn-pr** directly. When you create a fork, you have full read/ write permissions for the files in *your fork* instead. Then, you create a pull request to ask the Microsoft Docs team to accept the file changes from your fork into **MicrosoftDocs/learn-pr**

- **Full control over any pull requests that you initiate from your fork into MicrosoftDocs/learn-pr**. Having full control over your pull requests means that you can manage any subsequent file changes you commit to your fork. Your commits can be "rolled into" or removed from your open pull request. For example, you can modify files based on feedback, validation test results, and Microsoft reviews.

- **Individualized history of the file changes you commit**. Having access to a history of your file changes means that you can manage your own commits more efficiently. This approach also distinguishes your particular contributions to **MicrosoftDocs/learn-pr** from those of other contributors.

## Configure your GitHub user account {#fork-config-user}

Complete the following steps to configure your GitHub user account for contributing to the repo **MicrosoftDocs/learn-pr**.

1. Link your GitHub user account to your "v dash" (**v-**) account.

    > **Note**: For help linking your **v-** and GitHub accounts, refer to [GitHub account setup](https://review.docs.microsoft.com/help/contribute/contribute-get-started-setup-github?branch=master).
    >
    > If you've more than one email address associated with your Git user credentials, you can configure Git with multiple user credentials by referring to **Stack Overflow**: [Can I specify multiple users for myself in .gitconfig?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4220416/can-i-specify-multiple-users-for-myself-in-gitconfig).
    >

2. Sign into GitHub, and then go to the GitHub repo **MicrosoftDocs/learn-pr** at [https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/learn-pr/](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/learn-pr/).

    The contents of the GitHub repo **MicrosoftDocs/learn-pr** should now be accessible from your web browser.

    > **Note**: If your browser returns the following **GitHub 404 error web page**, your GitHub and **v-** accounts *cannot* access the repo. Verify that you're signed into GitHub with your linked **v-** account. If you still can't access **MicrosoftDocs/learn-pr**, contact your project manager for help.
    >

3. Join the **MicrosoftDocs** organization on GitHub, and then enable two-factor authentication.

    > **Note**: For more help with configuring your GitHub account for contributing to Microsoft Docs, refer to [GitHub account setup](https://review.docs.microsoft.com/help/contribute/contribute-get-started-setup-github?branch=master).
    >

You've configured your GitHub user account for contributing to Microsoft Docs successfully.
