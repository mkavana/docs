This guide describes how to invite a GitHub user as a collaborator to a GitHub repository (repo).

If you invite a collaborator to your GitHub repo, the collaborator can modify the files in your GitHub repo. For example, as part of a review, an author might add a reviewer as a collaborator. Then, the reviewer can modify files on the author's branch.

> **Note**: To follow this guide you *must* have the required user permissions for adding collaborators to your chosen GitHub repo (or fork). As an example, this guide invites the GitHub user **eamonnk** as a collaborator to the GitHub fork/ repo **mkavana/learn-pr**. The invitation to collaborate is sent from a personal GitHub account (free/ basic). Apply this guide to any suitable GitHub username and fork/ repo by adapting the steps accordingly.
