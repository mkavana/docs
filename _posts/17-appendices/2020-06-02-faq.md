faq:
    - question: Where do I start?
      answer: Guides that are essential to contributing content are collated on a single page in the [Quick Start](/quickstart/quickstart.html). Alternatively, choose a specific topic from the left sidebar menu. For example, there are guides in the section **Workflow and processes** that describe the *General workflow*, *Authoring process*, *Technical reviews*, *Instructional design reviews*, *Content editing*, and *Testing*. Beginning contributors should follow the guides in the section [Install software](/install/install-vsc.html), and then move on to the guides in the section [Workflow and processes](/workflow/terminology.html).

    - question: Do I need to install software?
      answer: Yes. Most contributors *must* install software by following the guides in the section [Install software](/install/install-vsc.html). To *view* the course files on GitHub or AzRepos, without installing software, follow the guide [View course files in web browser](/download-files/view-in-browser.html). If your project requires converting markdown files into Microsoft Word documents, install the software tools for converting files by following the guides in the section [Prepublication preparations](/pre-pub/prepub-about.html).

    - question: Where are the markdown files for my project?
      answer: Ask your project manager where the files for the project you're working on are stored, and how to access them. The files for most projects will be stored on GitHub, AzRepos, Teams, or SharePoint. To *view* markdown files on GitHub or AzRepos, without installing software, follow the guide [View course files in web browser](/download-files/view-in-browser.html). To edit or add content to files from GitHub or AzRepos, follow the guides in the section [Install software](/install/install-vsc.html), and then download (clone) the files from GitHub or AzRepos by following the guide [Download course files (clone repo)](/download-files/clone-repo.html).

    - question: What are Git, GitHub, and AzRepos?
      answer: Git is system of software tools for compartmentalizing a set of files into a unit called a "repo" (short for **repository**). Git implements version control by tracking the changes you make to each file in a repo, and Git can create and manage multiple repos. GitHub is a web service for hosting and sharing remote (public and private) repos. AzRepos is short for **Azure Repos**. AzRepos is a web service for hosting and sharing remote private repos. Terms and concepts, including *Git*, *GitHub*, and *AzRepos*, are explained in the guide [Terminology and concepts](/workflow/terminology.html), and in the [Glossary](/appendices/glossary.html).

    - question: What is a repo, a local repo, and a remote repo?
      answer: Git allows you to compartmentalize a set of files on your computer into a unit called a "repo" (short for **repository**. For example, the set of files for the course you're working on can be contained within a Git repo. Git implements version control by tracking the changes you make to each file in a repo. Terms and concepts, including *repo*, are explained in the guide [Terminology and concepts](/workflow/terminology.html), and in the [Glossary](/appendices/glossary.html). A repo on your computer or network is called a **local repo**. A repo on another computer, like on GitHub's servers, is called a **remote repo**.

    - question: How can I make a (local) repo?
      answer: Make a local repo by downloading (cloning) a GitHub or AzRepos repo by following the guide [Download course files (clone repo)](/download-files/clone-repo.html). For more information, refer to the GitHub documentation page [Creating, cloning, and archiving repositories](https://docs.github.com/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories).

    - question: How do I download (clone) a repo?
      answer: To download (clone) a GitHub or AzRepos repo, follow the guide [Download course files (clone repo)](/download-files/clone-repo.html). For more information, refer to the GitHub documentation page [Creating, cloning, and archiving repositories](https://docs.github.com/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories).

    - question: How do I create a new branch?
      answer: To create a new branch, follow the guide [Create new branch](/branches/new-branch.html).

    - question: How do I get the latest files (pull updates) from GitHub or AzRepos?
      answer: To get (pull) the latest files from GitHub or AzRepos, follow the guide [Update branch (pull)](/branches/pull-updates.html).

    - question: How do I delete a branch?
      answer: To delete a branch, follow the guide [Delete branch](/branches/delete-branch.html).

    - question: How do I recover a deleted branch?
      answer: To recover a deleted branch, follow the guide [Recover deleted branch](/branches/recover-branch.html).

    - question: How do I change/ switch between branches?
      answer: To change/ switch between branches, follow the guide [Switch branches](/branches/switch-branch.html).

    - question: How do I write in markdown?
      answer: To write in markdown, follow the guide [Add/ edit markdown in VSC](/add-content/edit-in-vsc.html). Make sure that the markdown you write adheres to the markdown syntax described in the guide [Markdown syntax guide](/add-content/syntax.html).

    - question: How do I create a new markdown file?
      answer: To create a new markdown file, follow the guide [Create new markdown file in VSC](/add-content/create-file.html).

    - question: How do I preview the contents of a markdown file?
      answer: Preview a markdown file in Visual Studio Code (VSC) using the **Open Preview to the Side** icon. Use the **Open Preview to the Side** icon to open a rendered version of your markdown file in a VSC **preview tab**, alongside the VSC **editor tab**. The shortcut keys **CTRL** + **SHIFT** + **M** also toggle VSC **Preview to the Side** mode on and off. To toggle a "full-window” markdown preview on and off, use the shortcut keys **CTRL** + **SHIFT** + **V**. Previewing in VSC is described in the guide [Add/ edit markdown in VSC](/add-content/edit-in-vsc.html). For more information about VSC shortcut keys, refer to [Key Bindings for Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/keybindings).

    - question: How do I add images into a markdown file?
      answer: To add images into a markdown file, follow the guide [Add/ edit images in VSC](/add-content/add-images.html).

    - question: Why is an image missing from the markdown preview?
      answer: For each image link you add into a markdown file, you *must* upload a corresponding image file (PNG). Upload the image file on the filepath that you specified in the image link text. If necessary, rename your image file according to the filename you specified in the image link text. Most projects use a **designated image storage directory** for image files (**media**). Make sure that the image link text in your markdown file is pointing to the correct image storage directory. Verify that the image file you're linking to is present, and stored in the correct directory. Check that the name of the image file matches the filename used in the image link text. Add images into a markdown file by following the guide [Add/ edit images in VSC](/add-content/add-images.html).

      answer: Checking that computer programming code and encoded text, like markdown, conforms to the correct syntax is called **linting**. A software tool that performs linting is called a **linter**. Terms and concepts, including *linting* and *linter*, are explained in the guide [Terminology and concepts](/workflow/terminology.html), and in the [Glossary](/appendices/glossary.html).

    - question: How do I fix a linting issue?
      answer: Fix a linting issue by following the guide [Fix linter issues](/add-content/fix-linter.html). 

    - question: How do I send (push) my files for review?
      answer: Send your files for review by following the guide [Send (push) files](/branches/push-files.html). The requirements for sending files for review depend on the type of review you're requesting. The requirements for sending files for review are described in the section **Workflow and processes**. There are guides that describe the *General workflow*, *Authoring process*, *Technical reviews*, *Instructional design reviews*, *Content editing*, and *Testing*.

    - question: What's a pull request (PR)?
      answer: A pull request (PR) is a request to approve merging (combining) the contents of one branch into another. For more information about pull requests, refer to the guide [Pull requests overview](/pull-requests/pr-overview.html), and the GitHub documentation page [About pull requests](https://docs.github.com/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests).
