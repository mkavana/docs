This guide describes how to use a merge commit to combine the changes from a Pull Request (PR) into a branch on GitHub.

> **Note**: This guide assumes you've an open GitHub PR that contains the changes you want to merge, and that you know the number of the GitHub PR you're merging.

## Topic 1: Examples of when to use a GitHub merge commit {#topic1}

This topic provides examples of when to use a merge commit to merge a GitHub PR.

When all your file changes are implemented, and you've opened a GitHub PR for your changes, the files in the GitHub PR *must* be merged back into the originating branch (like the master branch) using a merge commit.

The following are examples of when to use a merge commit to merge a GitHub PR.

### Authors

As part of the content authoring process, an author might create a new authoring branch from the **master** branch. When the author has finished developing content, the changes applied to the files on the authoring branch *must* be merged back into the master branch. The author pushes the files on their authoring branch "up" to GitHub, and then a GitHub PR is created to request merging the authoring branch back into master. When the proposed file changes within the GitHub PR have been approved by a GitHub reviewer, the contents of the GitHub PR are combined with the contents of the master branch using a GitHub merge commit.

### Reviewers

During the review process, a reviewer might modify an author's content. To compartmentalize the reviewer's changes, the reviewer might create a reviewer's branch based on the **originating author's branch**. When the reviewer has finished making changes, the reviewer's branch *must* be merged back into the originating author's branch. A GitHub PR is created to request combining the reviewer's branch with the originating author's branch. When the changes have been approved by a GitHub reviewer, the contents of the GitHub PR are combined with the contents of the originating author's branch using a GitHub merge commit.

> **Note**: Beyond the examples cited in this guide, the steps described in [Topic 2: Merge a GitHub PR](#topic2) can be applied to combine files from a GitHub PR with files on a branch (like master) using a GitHub merge commit.

> GitHub merge commit operations are usually performed by a *designated Waypoint team member* who is responsible for merging GitHub PRs. Your project manager can identify the appropriate Waypoint team member for you.

## Topic 2: Merge a GitHub PR {#topic2}

This topic describes how to merge a PR into a branch using a merge commit on GitHub.

When a GitHub PR is ready to be merged, the person who created the PR *must* send an email to the Waypoint team member responsible for merging GitHub PRs.

The email *must* state the following information:

- **Module number**. The number of the module/ unit that the GitHub PR to be merged relates to.
- **Task type**. The task performed on the files in the PR (for example, *ID review*, *content authoring*, etc.).
- **GitHub PR number**. The number of the GitHub PR to be merged.
- **Merging branch name**. The name of the branch the files are being merged *from* (for example, the name of your author's/ reviewer's branch).
- **Target branch**. The name of the branch the files are being merged *into* (for example, **master** or the name of an originating author's branch).
- **Confirmation**. Confirmation that all file changes have been implemented, the files have been reviewed, and the PR is ready to be merged into the originating branch.

The **Waypoint team member responsible for merging GitHub PRs** will perform the GitHub merge commit by completing the following actions:

1. In a web browser, sign into GitHub, and go to the project's GitHub repository (remote repo).

    For example, in the following image, the repo (**test-repo**) is open on GitHub.

2. Select the **Pull requests** tab.

3. From the list of **open** PRs, choose the PR to be merged.

4. In the **Conversation** tab, scroll down to the dropdown **Merge pull request**.

5. Verify the presence of the message **This branch has no conflicts with the base branch**.

   > **Note**: If GitHub indicates that there are merge conflicts, follow the guide [Resolve merge conflicts]({{site.baseutl}}/pull-requests/merge-conflicts.html), and then try merging the PR again.

6. Set the dropdown option to **Create a merge commit**.

7. Select **Merge pull request**.

8. Choose **Confirm merge** to confirm the merge action.

9. When the merge is complete, verify the presence of the message **Pull request successfully merged and closed**, and then delete the merged branch by selecting **Delete branch**.

    > **Note**: GitHub will notify the contributors assigned to the GitHub PR that the PR has been merged.
