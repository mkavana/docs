## Topic 1: Apply styles in Microsoft Word {#topic1}

1. Open a document in Microsoft Word.

2. Attach the template, and configure the styles by following the guide [Configure styles in Word]({{site.baseurl}}/pre-pub/config-styles.html).

3. Visually inspect the contents of the Word document for styling and formatting inconsistencies.

4. Work through the Word document, and select un-styled content.

5. Apply styling to the content by choosing an appropriate style from the Microsoft Word **Style Gallery**, in accordance with the design specification for the project you're working on.

    > **Note**: For details about common styles to apply, refer to [Topic 2: Common styles to apply](#topic2).
    >

6. After you've applied all the necessary styles, save your styled Word document.

7. Repeat steps **1** to **6** until you've styled all the Word documents for your project.

8. Upload the documents to the **designated storage directory** for "handing off" the documents to publication.

> **Note**: Prepublication preparation processes vary between projects. Ask your project manager about the design specification and designated directory for storing documents for publication, and how to access them.

## Topic 2: Common styles to apply {#topic2}

This topic provides an overview of common styles to apply to from Microsoft Word's **Style Gallery**.

### Front matter and titling

- Apply appropriate styles to **Course Title**, **Document Title**, and **Module Title**.

### Table of contents (ToC)

- A table of contents is not usually required. A ToC is generally added by the publisher, at a later stage, after prepublication.

### Body text

- Apply the style **Normal/Paragraph normal** to body text.

### Bolded and italicized text

- Apply the style **Inline bold** to occurrences of bolded text.
- Apply the style **Inline italics** to occurrences of italic text.

### Bulleted/ unordered lists

- Apply the style **Bullet level 1** to text to be displayed at the level 1 position in a bulleted list.
- Apply the style **Bullet level 2** to text to be displayed at the level 2 list position.
- Re-indent level 2 list items, as needed.

### Numbered/ ordered lists

- Apply the style **Numbered list 1** to text to be displayed at the level 1 position in a numbered list.
- Where applicable, restart the list numbering sequence at **1** by *right-selecting* the list items, and choosing **Restart at 1**.
- Apply the style **Numbered list 2** to text to be displayed at the level 2 list position.
- Re-indent level 2 list items and, where applicable, restart the list numbering sequence at **a**.

### Tables

- Apply the style **Table Content** to table cell data, or style **Table bullet** where appropriate.

### Captions

- Apply the style **Caption** to all table and figure captions.

### Images

- Verify that all necessary icons are present and used consistently.
- Some images might need to be manually resized during prepublication. Check with your project manager.

### Question prompt text

- Apply the style **Prompt** to question prompt text, as required. Question prompt text typically appears before a multiple-choice question.

### Additional styles

- Apply other styles from the **Style Gallery** in accordance with the design specification for the project you're working on.
