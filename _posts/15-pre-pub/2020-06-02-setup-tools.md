    > **Note**: If you do not use Windows 64-bit, choose your operating system platform (like Linux or macOS, etc.) from the menu on the right side. Follow the online instructions for accessing the Pandoc **Download page** to download and install the version of Pandoc appropriate to your operating system.

5. When the installation has completed, choose **Finish**.

    Pandoc does not provide a *Graphical User Interface* (GUI). Instead, Pandoc provides a CLI for performing file conversions that you can access from a Shell (like Windows Command Prompt or Terminal in Linux and macOS).
