> As an example, this guide restores a deleted branch named **old-branch** to a sample AzDevOps repository **example-repo**. Modify the following instructions to suit your preferred AzDevOps repository (repo).

## Restore a deleted branch to AzDevOps {#az-restore-branch}

Complete the following steps to restore a deleted branch to AzDevOps.

1. Open a web browser, go to the AzDevOps website at [https://dev.azure.com](https://dev.azure.com), and sign in.

2. On the **Projects** tab, locate the project repo with the branch you want to restore, and select the **Repos** icon.

    For example, in the following image, the **Repos** icon for the project **example-repo** is selected.

3. Select **Branches** from the left side menu.

4. In the search box, upper right side, enter the name of the deleted branch you want to recover.

    For example, in the following image, the name of the deleted branch **old-branch** is entered into the search box.

5. In the **Deleted branches** pane, select the vertical ellipsis (**`â‹®`**) icon beside the branch you want recover (on the right side), and then choose **Restore branch**.

    For example, in the following image, the **Restore branch** option is selected for the deleted branch named **old-branch**.

6. The message **Successfully restored \<branch_name\>** indicates that the branch is recovered successfully.

    The recovered branch is now available from the **Branches** pane, under the **All** tab.

    For example, in the following image, the message **Successfully restored old-branch** indicates that the branch named **old-branch** is recovered successfully. In the following image, the branch **old-branch** is listed in the **Branches** pane, under the **All** tab.
